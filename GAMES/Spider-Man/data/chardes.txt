Bonesaw McGraw is just some guy.  For all I know, he may even be a decent guy.  I mean, really, other than having the bad luck to
be the first poor schmoe on the receiving end of a Spidey smackdown. I don't have any reason to think he's done anything wrong.
This guy killed my Uncle Ben.  In a way, he's also the one who taught me, as much as Uncle Ben did, that great power requires great
responsibility.  That's a lesson I'll never forget.
Helping damsels in distress is practically my middle name...
which I guess makes me 'Spider - helping - damsels - in - distress - Man.'  Maybe I should just stick with 'Spidey'.
Oscorp scientists are the bread and butter for Oscorp's research programs.

The boss.  The big cheese.  The main man.  J.J. is publisher of the Daily Bugle.  He hates Spider-Man for some reason, and he isn't
exactly the most generous guy I ever met, but I suppose I could do worse for a boss... like maybe Ebenezer Scrroge.
Kraven claims to be the world's greatest big game hunter.  I dunno what I did to get on his bad side, but Kraven got it into his crazy
head to hunt ME!  I have to admire his fashion sense though...it takes guts to go out in public weraing leopard print tights.
I don't know what's up with these things.  They just attacked me with no warning.  I'll definitely have to figure that out when I have a chance.

I don't like to talk about it, but every time I find a guy in trouble, I see my uncle's face...

I'm just going to sit here and stare for a while.  Don't mind me.

Norman Osborn is a talented scientist and an even more talented business man.  He's a self-made man and he's always been really kind to me,
although sometimes he's a little tough on his son, Harry.
These guys are Oscorp's basic rent-a-cops.  They aren't much in a fight, but if they make it to an alarm, things get ugly.
Not that it ever made me feel any better about punching them in the face...
That's me.  Peter Parker.  I've always liked the term 'mild-mannered,' personally, but some people have used harsher terms.
(sarcastic)I think they're just jealous of my glamorous job and flashy wardrobe.
It's hard to figure out Scorpion... Someone did something to him.  Of course, he may have been crazy to start with.  Still, I can't
help feeling sorry for the guy.
No matter what anyone says about me, these guys are the real heroes!

These are Shocker's basic thugs.  They get points for style, but I wish they were more aerodynamic...
none               
Apparently, Shocker's real name is Herman Shulz.  He built those shock blast gauntlets to open safes, I guess.
All I know is my bones are still rattling.  He is SO going to end up with carpal tunnel syndrome, though...
What to say about myself.  I mean, there's the obvious: web-swinging, wall-crawling, spider sense stuff, but what about me?
none
The real me?  Ah, you don't care about that.  On with the baddie beatings! These guys were hanging around when I got attacked
by those flying robots.  I have to figure that wasn't a coincidence. I mean, how many robot-building enemies could I have?
Yes, I made this costume myself.  In my defense, I had to put it together on pretty short notice, so I don't want to hear
any snickers from the peanut gallery.  I think I still have this outfit in my closet somewhere...
I guess this guy is in charge of Oscorp's super soldier project for the military.
none               
This robot is about the scariest thing I've ever seen.  Between the giant laser, the huge fist,
and the miscellaneous gun turrets and missile launchers, it's a miracle I made it through in one piece.
Ah yes.  The Skulls.  What a bunch of losers.

My Uncle Ben was probably the kindest, most generous person I've ever known.  He was like a father to me, and, more than anyone else,
he made me the person I am.  I'll always remember him!

The Vulture, aka Adrian Toomes, is a talented engineer.  Note to aspiring superheroes: if you can't fly, try to pick non-flying villains!

Even though he's gotta be, like, a hundred, that flying rig of his increases his strength, so he's a lot more dangerous than he looks.
These guys are just bad news.
Harry's one of my best friends going way back.  He's a great guy, but I think he feels like he lives in his father's shadow an awful lot.

My Aunt May helped raise me after my parents died.  She's the closest thing to a mother I've ever known.  I know she still misses Uncle Ben,
but she's a tough lady.  She doesn't let anything stop her for long!
I never could have imagined that Green Goblin was Norman Osborn!  He helped raise me... I guess he must
have been pretty surprised to discover that I was Spider-Man, too.  I'm just sorry it had to end the way it did... Harry took it really hard...
Man some people will just roll over at the drop of a hat.  All I did was dangle him off a roof...what a crybaby...
