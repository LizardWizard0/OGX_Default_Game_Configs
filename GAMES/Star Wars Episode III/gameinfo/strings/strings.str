###Concept Art
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_SEPARATIST_CRUISER1]JEDI ESCAPE
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_SEPARATIST_CRUISER1_LONG]CRUISER - JEDI ESCAPE
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_SEPARATIST_CRUISER1_DESC]This sequence was cut from the film but was retained for the game.  We see Anakin and Obi-Wan, surrounded by droids, making a daring escape by cutting a hole in the floor with their lightsabers.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_SEPARATIST_CRUISER2]GENERATOR ROOM
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_SEPARATIST_CRUISER2_LONG]GENERATOR ROOM
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_SEPARATIST_CRUISER2_DESC]More from the cut sequence that remained in the game.  Here Anakin and Obi-Wan navigate the cruiser’s generator room, which is filling up with volatile fuel, pouring in from cracks in the damaged walls.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BUZZDROID]Buzz droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BUZZDROID_LONG]Buzz droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BUZZDROID_DESC]These insect-like droids are seen in the film dismantling Jedi starfighters during the Battle of Coruscant. The game explores the Buzz Droid’s functionality against Jedi Knights on foot.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRAPPLEDROID1]Grapple droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRAPPLEDROID1_LONG]Grapple droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRAPPLEDROID1_DESC]Early concept of Grapple Droid which doesn't have the electric shock mechanism. The body and the panel lines show more resemblance to the Super Battle Droid.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRAPPLEDROID2]Grapple droid - BLUE
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRAPPLEDROID2_LONG]Grapple droid - BLUE
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRAPPLEDROID2_DESC]Grapple Droids are the walking tanks of the droid army. They're a variation of the Super Battle Droid, but they lack arm-mounted blasters.  They rely on their melee attacks and grappling techniques.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BUZZDROID_GEN]BUZZ DROID GENERATOR
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BUZZDROID_GEN_LONG]BUZZ DROID GENERATOR (CUT)
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BUZZDROID_GEN_DESC]The final concept image of Buzz Droid Generator. Generators were planned to hover and populate the levels with Buzz Droids. This Separatist unit was cut from the game during the final revision.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_AIRBATTLEDROID]Air battle droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_AIRBATTLEDROID_LONG]Air battle droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_AIRBATTLEDROID_DESC]Air Battle Droids are the upgraded flying versions of the standard battle droid. Unlike the ground units, the fliers are equipped with a short blade, an arm-mounted blaster and a shield that can block lightsabers.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_HALLWAYS1]HALLWAY 1
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_HALLWAYS1_LONG]CRUISER - HALLWAY 1
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_HALLWAYS1_DESC]Early game concept art of Anakin cutting through battle droids in a Separatist cruiser hallway.  This is based on early cruiser reference and concept work done for the film.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_HALLWAYS2]HALLWAY 2
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_HALLWAYS2_LONG]CRUISER - HALLWAY 2
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_HALLWAYS2_DESC]Another early game concept of Anakin taking on one of the newly created Grapple Droids.  This concept shows the dramatic dismembering effects for the droid characters.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRENADIERDROID]Grenadier droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRENADIERDROID_LONG]Grenadier droid
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_GRENADIERDROID_DESC]Grenadier Droids are effectively short range artillery platforms. This character was created in an early stage of development, but ultimately didn't have enough features to make the game.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE1]BRIDGE 1
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE1_LONG]CRUISER - BRIDGE 1
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE1_DESC]This is another sequence cut from the film that remained a key part of the game.  Here Obi-Wan battles the General Grievous onboard the damaged, and now sideways, Separatist cruiser.  They must now fight on the windows of the ship's bridge.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE2]BRIDGE 2
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE2_LONG]CRUISER - BRIDGE 2
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE2_DESC]As the Separatist cruiser continues its damaged rotation, the bridge is turned fully upside down.  The Jedi must fight Grievous' bodyguards on the ceiling, which has now become the floor.

[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE3]BRIDGE 3
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE3_LONG]CRUISER - BRIDGE 3
[IDS_SHELL_CONCEPTART_BRIDGE3_DESC]This is concept image from the film of the upside down Separatist cruiser bridge.  The bodyguard droids are magnetized to the ceiling, able to fight upside down.  However, they are still no match for the Jedi’s skills.

[IDS_MOV_M03_010_OBW2]This time we will do it together.
[IDS_MOV_M03_010_AKN2]I was about to say that.
[IDS_MOV_M03_010_DKU1]Your swords, please. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
[IDS_MOV_M03_010_OBW3]You won't get away this time, Dooku.
[IDS_MOV_M03_010_DKU2]Just because there are two of you, do not assume you have the advantage.
[IDS_MOV_M03_020_PLP3]You did well, Anakin. 
[IDS_MOV_M03_020_PLP4]He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
[IDS_MOV_M03_020_PLP5]Now we must leave.
[IDS_MOV_M03_020_PLP6]Leave him or we'll never make it.
[IDS_MOV_M03_020_AKN3]His fate will be the same as ours.
[IDS_MOV_M04_010_GGR1]Prepare for attack.
[IDS_MOV_M04_010_SHC1]All batteries fire. Fire!
[IDS_MOV_M04_010_AKN1]Elevator's not working.
[IDS_MOV_M04_010_AKN2]Artoo, activate elevator 3224.
[IDS_MOV_M04_010_OBW1]Let’s find another way around
[IDS_MOV_M04_010_OBW2]The Chancellor and I will meet you on the other side. 
[IDS_MOV_M04_020_AKN1]Ray shields.
[IDS_MOV_M04_020_OBW1]Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.
[IDS_MOV_M04_020_AKN2]Apparently not.
[IDS_MOV_M04_020_AKN3]Artoo will be along in a few moments and then he'll release the ray shields.
[IDS_MOV_M04_020_AKN4]See. No problem.
[IDS_MOV_M04_020_OBW2]Do you have a plan B?
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_GGR1]Ah yes. The negotiator.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_BDD1]Excuse me.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_GGR2]That wasn't much of a rescue.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_GGR3]Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_OBW1]Not this time.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_OBW2]And this time, you won't escape.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_AKN1]Artoo.
[IDS_MOV_M05_010_GGR4]Crush them.
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_GGR1]You lose, General Kenobi.
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_GGR2]Ha ha ha. Time to abandon ship.
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_OBW1]Can you fly a cruiser like this?
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_AKN1]You mean do I know how to land what's left of this thing.
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_OBW2]Well?
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_AKN2]Well, under the circumstances I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
[IDS_MOV_M05_020_AKN3]Strap yourselves in.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN1]You're going to need me on this one, Master.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_OBW1]Oh, I agree. However, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN2]Master.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN3]I've disappointed you.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN4]I've been arrogant.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN5]I've just been so frustrated with the Council.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_OBW2]You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you.
##Deleted:MOV_M06A_010_OBW3]And, Anakin, I'm taking enough 
##clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. So please, ##don't worry about me.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN6]Master.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_AKN7]May the Force be with you.
[IDS_MOV_M06A_010_OBW4]Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
[IDS_MOV_M06B_010_OBW1]Hello there.
[IDS_MOV_M06B_010_GGR1]General Kenobi, ha ha ha ha ha. 
[IDS_MOV_M06B_010_GGR2]You are a bold one.
[IDS_MOV_M06B_010_GGR3]Ha ha ha.
[IDS_MOV_M06B_010_GGR4]Kill him.
[IDS_MOV_M07_010_GGR1]Here is where you meet your end, Kenobi.
[IDS_MOV_M07_010_OBW1]We'll see about that.
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_MWD1]I'm going to end this, once and for all.
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_AKN1]You can't.
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_AKN3]He must stand trial.
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_AKN4]I need him!
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_AKN5]No!
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_AKN6]What are you doing?!
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_MWD2]He's a traitor to the Republic -- Letting him live is too dangerous.
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_AKN7]Letting you kill him is against our Jedi beliefs.  I won't allow it.
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_MWD3]Anakin -- come to your senses!
[IDS_MOV_M08_010_MWD4]So be it.
[IDS_MOV_M08_020_AKN1]What have I done?
[IDS_MOV_M08_020_DSD2]You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.
#Deleted: M08_020_DSD3Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_DSD1]Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_DSD4]Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_AKN1]I want access to the temple's signal beacon.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_JNU1]On whose authority?
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_AKN2]By order of the Supreme Chancellor.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_JNU2]That is not within the Chancellor's power.  Only the Jedi Council can authorize access.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_AKN3]The Council is no longer in control.
[IDS_MOV_M09_010_JPL1]You won't get away with this, Skywalker.
[IDS_MOV_M11_010_DSD2]The time has come.
[IDS_MOV_M11_010_DSD3]Execute Order 66.
[IDS_MOV_M11_010_OBW1]You're too late to help me here, troopers. Head up to the next platform.
[IDS_MOV_M11_010_CLT1]I'm sorry, sir, we are no longer required to follow your orders.
[IDS_MOV_M11_010_OBW2]What did you say, soldier?
[IDS_MOV_M11_020_BOG1]Master Kenobi.
[IDS_MOV_M11_020_OBW1]Senator Organa?
[IDS_MOV_M11_020_OBW2]My clone troops turned on me. I need help.
[IDS_MOV_M11_020_BOG2]We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.
[IDS_MOV_M11_020_BOG3]We're sending you our coordinates.
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_AKN1]Artoo, stay with the ship.
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_NMA1]Lord Vader.  Our masters have been anxiously awaiting your arrival.
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_AKN2]Good.  And where are they now?
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_NMA2]In the central Control Room, sir.  
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_AKN3]Good. I have a message, from Darth Sidious.
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_NMA3]Message?  What message?
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_AKN4]This--
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_RHO1]Darth Sidious has betrayed us!
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_NGY1]Security!  Get down there and stop the assassin!
[IDS_MOV_M12_010_POG1]Not to worry. We're quite safe here.
[IDS_MOV_M12_020_AKN1]The Separatists have been taken care of, my Master.
[IDS_MOV_M12_020_DSD1]It is finished then.
[IDS_MOV_M12_020_DSD2]You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy, Lord Vader. 
[IDS_MOV_M12_020_AKN2]Thank you, my Master.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_OBW1]How many other Jedi have managed to survive?
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_YDA1]Heard from no one, have we.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_BOG1]I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_YDA2]Received a coded retreat message, we have.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_BOG2]It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says the war is over.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_OBW2]Well then we must go back.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_YDA3]Hmm. Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_OBW3]I can only hope we're not too late.  I don't wish to be the last of the Jedi. 
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_YDA4]To the very summit of the temple, we must go.  There shall we find the beacon, and end this deception.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_OBW4]Master... I fear for Anakin.
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_YDA5]Mmmm. Clouded is his fate. Concerned for him, I am. 
[IDS_MOV_M13_010_YDA6]Quickly, young Obi-Wan.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_OBW2]Wait, Master. There is something I must know.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_OBW3]I must know the truth, Master.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_YDA2]If in to the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_OBW4]It can't be.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_DSD1]You have done well, my new apprentice.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_DSD2]Now, Lord Vader, go and bring peace to the Empire.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_OBW5]I can't watch anymore.
[IDS_MOV_M13_020_YDA3]Destroy the Sith, we must.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_OBW1]You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now...
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_OBW2]Until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_AKN1]Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_AKN2]I see through the lies of the Jedi.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_AKN3]I do not fear the dark side as you do.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_AKN4]Don't make me kill you.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_OBW3]I will do what I must.
[IDS_MOV_M14_010_AKN5]You will try, my old friend.
[IDS_MOV_M14_020_DSD1]Lord Vader?
[IDS_MOV_M14_020_DSD2]Can you hear me?
[IDS_MOV_M14_020_DVD1]Yes, Master.
[IDS_MOV_M170_STR1]We think they may be splitting up. They may be on levels 5 and 6 now, sir.
[IDS_MOV_M170_DVD1]I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
[IDS_MOV_M170_DVD2]We meet again, at last. 
[IDS_MOV_M170_DVD3]The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the Master.
[IDS_CIN_M01_030_AKN1]He says the droids have activated a lockout protocol.
[IDS_CIN_M01_030_OBW1]Is there any way around it?
[IDS_CIN_M01_030_AKN2]There's a shut-off in that landing grid over there. I'll take care of it.
[IDS_CIN_M01_040_OBW1]Anakin -- I could use your help here!
[IDS_CIN_M01_050_AKN1]Artoo's done it!
[IDS_CIN_M01_050_OBW1]Let's get moving -- The Chancellor's waiting!
[IDS_CIN_M01_050_AKN2]We can handle this, Artoo. You stay here with the ships.
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_AKN1]Don't worry, Master.
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_OBW1]I'm not worried.
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_AKN2]This'll be no problem.
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_OBW2]Did I say I was worried?
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_AKN3]This might be a problem.
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_BDD1]Warning: Fuel breach in chamber seven.  Activate containment doors.  Lock-down protocol initiated.
[IDS_MOV_M02A_010_OBW3]All right.  Now I'm worried.
[IDS_CIN_M02A_050_AKN1]Do you want this one, or should I take it?
[IDS_CIN_M02A_050_OBW1]By all means, Anakin.  Help yourself.
[IDS_CIN_M02A_070_AKN1]Think you can hold it alone?
[IDS_CIN_M02A_070_OBW1]Let’s find out.
[IDS_CIN_M02B_010_AKN1]I won't be long, Master.
[IDS_CIN_M02B_010_OBW1]Be careful.
[IDS_CIN_M02B_010_OBW2]Always on the move ...
[IDS_CIN_M02B_030_OBW1]Anakin -- If you're not too busy, we still have to rescue the Chancellor.
[IDS_CIN_M02B_030_AKN1]Yes, Master -- I've just ... run into some old friends.
[IDS_CIN_M02B_030_OBW2]Well, when you're finished out there -- 
[IDS_CIN_M02B_030_OBW3]Now what?
[IDS_CIN_M02B_040_AKN1]Artoo.  Where is Obi-Wan?
[IDS_CIN_M02B_040_AKN2]Well, can you open the door?
[IDS_CIN_M02B_050_AKN1]Master, wait!  This one's not--
[IDS_CIN_M02B_070_OBW1]We're about to become a lot thinner. 
[IDS_CIN_M02B_070_OBW2]Quick -- back into the car!
[IDS_CIN_M02B_070_AKN1]You first, Master!
[IDS_CIN_M02B_070_OBW3]There's no time to argue -- Go!
[IDS_CIN_M02B_070_OBW4]Next time we're taking the stairs.
[IDS_CIN_M04B_020_BDD1]Alert!  Hull Breach in Sector Seven! Alert!
[IDS_CIN_M04B_020_BDD2]Initiating emergency magnetic shield on Sectors Seven and Eight.
[IDS_CIN_M04B_020_AKN1]I never thought I'd be so happy to see a ray shield! 
[IDS_CIN_M04B_020_AKN2]I’m glad you’re safe, Artoo.
[IDS_CIN_M04B_020_AKN3]Let’s go see how much trouble Obi-Wan’s got himself into now. 
[IDS_CIN_M04B_030_OBW1]Artoo, we need to get that ray shield deactivated.
[IDS_CIN_M04B_030_JPL1]Calling all open Jedi channels -- this is Jedi Cruiser 622 requesting immediate assistance!
[IDS_CIN_M04B_030_JPL2]We're taking heavy fire -- situation critical!  We're going down!
[IDS_CIN_M04B_030_OBW2]Anakin, quickly -- get into that turret.  We've got to save that Cruiser!
[IDS_CIN_M04B_040_OBW1]Nice shooting.
[IDS_CIN_M04B_040_AKN1]You expected less?
[IDS_CIN_M04B_040_AKN2]Let's get moving, we need to meet up with Artoo.
[IDS_CIN_M05_030_GGR1]Foolish Jedi!
[IDS_CIN_M05_030_GGR2]Finish them off.  Bring me their lightsabers ... And their heads!
[IDS_CIN_M05_040_BDD1]Gyroscopes online.  Orientation normalizing.  Standby.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_020_OBW1]Commander Cody, this is General Obi-Wan Kenobi!  Do you copy?
[IDS_CIN_M06B_020_CMC1]Loud and clear, sir.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_020_OBW2]General Grievous has escaped.  I need you to lock onto his signal, and track him for me.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_020_CMC2]Understood, sir.  Beginning signal scan.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_020_CMC3]Sir!  We're taking fire.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_020_OBW3]I'll take care of those cannons.  You concentrate on finding Grievous.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_BDD1]Activate emergency defense shields.  
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_BDD2]Broad-band lockdown activated.  All levels secured.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_OBW1]Ray shields. This just keeps getting better.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_CLT1]Sir.  
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_CLT2]The shields have blocked our reinforcements. Disable them and we'll have clear access to the entire stronghold.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_OBW2]Good. Where?
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_CLT3]Down there! 
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_CLT4]Good luck, sir.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_040_OBW3]Luck? In my experience, there's no such thing.
[IDS_CIN_M06B_070_CMC1]General Kenobi!  We've located Grievous!
[IDS_CIN_M06B_070_OBW1]I'm in.  Let's go.
[IDS_CIN_M07_010_GGR1]Here is where you meet your end, Kenobi.
[IDS_CIN_M07_010_OBW1]We'll see about that.
[IDS_CIN_M07_040_GGR1]What?!
[IDS_CIN_M07_040_OBW1]You'll have to do better than that.
[IDS_CIN_M07_040_GGR2]Ha ha ha ha!
[IDS_CIN_M07_040_GGR3]Let's finish this.
[IDS_CIN_M08_020_MWD1]He's manipulating you.  Making you betray  the Jedi order.  Can't you see that?
[IDS_CIN_M08_020_AKN1]The only thing I see is a Jedi trying to assassinate a politician. You're the one who's betraying the Republic!
[IDS_CIN_M08_025_MWD1]You have been tainted by the dark side...
[IDS_CIN_M08_025_AKN1]No.
[IDS_CIN_M08_025_MWD2]... And you have failed the Jedi Order.
[IDS_CIN_M08_025_AKN2]No!!
[IDS_CIN_M08_030_MWD1]Your reign of evil ends now. 
[IDS_CIN_M08_030_AKN1]No -- It's your treachery that's finished.
[IDS_CIN_M09_060A_CLT1]Sir -- We've breached the beacon control room.  
[IDS_CIN_M09_060A_CLT2]We're awaiting your access code.
[IDS_CIN_M09_060B_AKN1]That will bring any surviving Jedi home, where I'll be waiting for them.
[IDS_CIN_M09_060B_CLT1]Lord Vader, a Jedi has penetrated our upper level defenses.
[IDS_CIN_M09_060B_AKN2]Yes. I sense ... Cin Drallig. 
[IDS_CIN_M09_060B_AKN3]I'll deal with him.  You stay and protect the beacon.  Guard it with your lives.
[IDS_CIN_M10_010_SER1]You shouldn't have come here.
[IDS_CIN_M10_010_AKN1]Serra.  Cin Drallig's greatest pupil has come to greet me. 
[IDS_CIN_M10_030_AKN1]Your favorite student is no more.
[IDS_CIN_M10_040_CIN1]There's one lesson you've yet to learn -- How to become one with the Force.
[IDS_CIN_M10_040_AKN1]I am no longer the learner. It's your turn now.
[IDS_CIN_M10_050_AKN1]This will be a day long remembered.  Soon the Jedi will be no more.
[IDS_CIN_M11_013_CLT1]I've spotted the Jedi!
[IDS_CIN_M11_013_CLT2]Concentrate fire on the target!
[IDS_CIN_M11_013_CLT3]Take him down!
[IDS_CIN_M11_050_OBW1]How do I keep getting myself into these situations?
[IDS_CIN_M11_050_CLB1]Destroy the Jedi!
[IDS_CIN_M11_050_OBW2]Well ... Anywhere's better than here.
[IDS_CIN_M12_090_RHO1]He's locked it!  We're trapped!
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_RHO1]Stop... 
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_RHO2]I'm asking you for mercy. 
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_AKN1]Mercy?
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_RHO3]Yes... 
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_RHO4]You won't kill me. 
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_RHO5]It's not allowed, for a Jedi Knight.
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_AKN2]There is much you fail to understand.
[IDS_CIN_M12_100_RHO6]Gaaaah!
[IDS_CIN_M13_020_OBW1]We seem to have attracted some unwanted attention.
[IDS_CIN_M13_020_YDA1]Divide that attention we can.  
[IDS_CIN_M13_020_OBW2]Shall we split up?
[IDS_CIN_M13_020_YDA2]And may the Force soon bring us together again.
[IDS_CIN_M13_040_YDA1]A peculiar skill you have, Master Obi-Wan, for finding trouble.
[IDS_CIN_M13_060_OBW1]I've never seen anything so cruel.  Why would the Clones do this?
[IDS_CIN_M13_060_YDA1]Responsible for this, the Clones are not.
[IDS_CIN_M13_060_OBW2]No...
[IDS_CIN_M13_060_YDA2]An act of hatred this was. Strong is the dark side now. 
[IDS_CIN_M14_010_OBW1]Anakin -- please! Come back to the light.  Face up to what you've done.  I can help you!
[IDS_CIN_M14_010_AKN1]It's too late for that.  You're too late.  You only want to help yourself.
[IDS_CIN_M14_010_OBW2]You know that's not true!
[IDS_CIN_M14_030_OBW1]I only wanted what was best for you, Anakin.  I wasn't prepared to train ... Someone like you.
[IDS_CIN_M14_030_AKN1]That's your failing, not mine! 
[IDS_CIN_M14_030_OBW2]Perhaps I did fail you -- But I won't abandon you to the dark side!
[IDS_CIN_M14_030_AKN2]That's not your decision to make!
[IDS_MOV_M14_020_OBW1]It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
[IDS_MOV_M14_020_AKN1]You underestimate the dark side of the Force.
[IDS_MOV_M14_020_OBW2]Don't try it.
[IDS_CIN_M15_010_OBW1]It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
[IDS_CIN_M15_010_AKN1]You underestimate the dark side of the Force.
[IDS_CIN_M15_010_OBW2]Don't try it.
[IDS_CIN_M15_010_DSD1]Excellent work, my apprentice, there are none left to oppose us. The galaxy is ours now.
[IDS_CIN_M15_010_DSD2]Your new weapon, Lord Vader.
[IDS_CIN_M15_010_AKN2]No ... The galaxy belongs to me.
[IDS_MOV_M170_020_LUK1]No!
[IDS_MOV_M170_020_LEI1]Come on!
[IDS_MOV_M170_020_HAN1]Blast the door, kid!
[IDS_MOV_M170_020_OBW1]Run, Luke, Run.

### Level Descriptions
###Do not match normal naming convention, just in sequential order
[IDS_OVERVIEW_01]\left_image:anakin \right_image:obi-wan \b Anakin Skywalker \-b returns from the outer rim to thwart \b General Grievous' \-b kidnapping plot, together with \b Obi-Wan Kenobi \-b \right_image:sepcruiser the two Jedi raid the \b Separatist Flagship \-b to locate and retrieve \b Chancellor Palpatine\-b...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_02]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:sepcruiser As the battle rages above \b Coruscant\-b, \b Obi-Wan \-b continues the quest to find \right_image:palpatine the \b Supreme Chancellor \-b aboard the \b Separatist cruiser \-b with help from \b Anakin Skywalker \-b. But the Jedi are unaware that their every move is being tracked \right_image:grievous on the ship's command bridge by the leader of the droid forces, \b General Grievous\-b...  
[IDS_OVERVIEW_03]\left_image:anakin \right_image:sepcruiser \b Anakin \-b continues to \b Palpatine's \-b location on the cruiser's upper levels, \right_image:palpatine assisted by \b Obi-Wan\-b, determined to retrieve the \b Chancellor \-b from \b Grievous' \-b clutches. Continued pursuit from the ship's patrolling droids \right_image:r2d2 threatens the Jedi, while \b R2-D2 \-b attempts to aid the Jedi in their ascent...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_04]\left_image:anakin \right_image:r2d2 With some help from \b R2-D2\-b, \b Anakin \-b leads \b Obi-Wan \-b to their final destination and the Jedi are poised to liberate the \b Chancellor\-b.  The only thing blocking their path is \right_image:dooku a stately former Jedi named \b Count Dooku\-b, who is now the Sith Lord known as \b Darth Tyranus\-b...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_05]\left_image:anakin \right_image:palpatine There is a sinister mood as \b Palpatine \-b witnesses \b Anakin's \-b flirtation with the dark side while getting revenge on \b Count Dooku\-b. The young Jedi must now lead the \b Chancellor \-b and \b Obi-Wan \-b toward the cruiser's hangar.  \right_image:r2d2 But the furious combat outside begins to take its toll on the \right_image:sepcruiser \b Separatist flagship \-b and \b R2-D2 \-b will again need to aid in the rescue...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_06]\left_image:anakin \right_image:grievous Their escape foiled, the Jedi and \b Palpatine \-b are brought before the dreaded \b General Grievous\-b, \right_image:gbg who is flanked by his formidable droid bodyguards. Down but not out, \b Anakin \-b and \b Obi-Wan \-b still have \right_image:obi-wan a few tricks remaining in their rescue mission. Hopefully, \right_image:sepcruiser the \b Separatist cruiser \-b will stay in orbit long enough for them to be used...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_07]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:palpatine \b Obi-Wan \-b and \b Anakin \-b get the \b Chancellor \-b safely back to \b Coruscant\-b, ending the Separatist ploy. With \b Dooku \-b defeated, the \b Jedi Council \-b doubles its efforts \right_image:grievous to bring \b General Grievous \-b to justice.  Tracking \b Grievous \-b to the \b Utapau \-b system, \right_image:utapau the Council sends \b Obi-Wan \-b after the Separatist leader, this time without the aid of \b Anakin \-b. \n Already frustrated by the Council, \right_image:anakin \b Anakin \-b is further dismayed to learn that \b Mace Windu \-b suspects \b Chancellor Palpatine \-b is behind the perpetuation of the Clone Wars.  \right_image:mace The conflicted young Jedi is now stuck on \b Coruscant\-b, faced with the growing divide between his friend and mentor, the \b Chancellor\-b, and the \b Jedi Order\-b, \right_image:utapau without the guidance of \b Obi-Wan\-b, who begins his daring mission on \b Utapau\-b...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_08]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:grievous After successfully navigating the Separatist stronghold, \b Obi-Wan Kenobi \-b locates \b Grievous \-b and must apprehend the general to complete his mission and end the Clone Wars. However, in order to flush out \b Grievous\-b, \right_image:gbg Obi-Wan must face not only his bodyguards, but also endless waves of droid forces without the help of his clone army...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_09]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:grievous In the chaos of the Separatists' defeat on \b Utapau\-b, \b General Grievous \-b attempts to escape, racing toward his hidden starship. \right_image:cody With help from \bCommander Cody\-b,\bObi-Wan \-b catches sight of the fleeing droid and mounts a pursuit on the back of the native lizard, \right_image:grievous \b Boga\-b, chasing \b Grievous \-b toward their final showdown...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_10]\left_image:coruscant \right_image:mace Meanwhile on \b Coruscant\-b, \b Mace Windu \-b gathers incriminating information against \b Palpatine \-b and confronts the \b Chancellor \-b in his quarters.  \left_image:palpatine It's there that \b Palpatine \-b reveals his true identity as the Sith Lord that's controlling the \b Galactic Senate\-b.  Just as \b Mace \-b is about to strike \b Palpatine \-b down, \left_image:anakin a bewildered \b Anakin \-b enters the room and sees his friend on the wrong end of what appears to be a Jedi assassination attempt...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_11]\left_image:anakin \right_image:sidious Having made his choice in striking at \b Mace Windu\-b, \b Anakin \-b places all of his trust with \b Palpatine\-b, who goes to work on \b Anakin\-b, playing on his fears and anxieties. The crafty Sith Lord manipulates \b Anakin \-b into believing that the \right_image:coruscant Jedi Order betrayed the \b Republic \-b and him, and that \b Obi-Wan \-b is equally complicit. The \b Chancellor's \-b words are powerful, and they sway the young Jedi.  \left_image:anakinhood \b Anakin \-b swears his allegiance to \b Palpatine \-b - and to the dark side of the Force.  \n Seduced by his newfound power, \right_image:clonetrooper the newly christened \b Darth Vader \-b is sent to the \b Jedi Temple \-b on a quest to send the traitorous Jedi to their doom...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_12]\left_image:anakinhood \right_image:coruscant Despite Darth Vader's ferocity throughout the Temple, the Jedi refuse to go quietly.  The harder the Jedi fight against him, the more convinced of their corruption and treachery the young Sith Lord becomes, which only fuels his anger and furthers his descent into the dark side.  \n Deep within the Jedi Temple, \right_image:cindrallig an incredibly skilled swordsman and Jedi Master named Cin Drallig prepares for Vader's coming.  But before Cin can act, his most accomplished apprentice, Serra, \right_image:serra confronts Vader on her own.  With the fate of the Jedi Order at stake, these two Jedi are the Temple's last hope...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_13]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:utapau The Separatist armies on \b Utapau \-b are beaten back, falling under the might of \b Obi-Wan Kenobi \-b and his Clone army.  But \b Obi-Wan's \-b victory is short-lived \right_image:cody as \b Clone Commander Cody \-b receives a secret, coded message directly from \b Darth Sidious\-b, implementing \b "Order 66" \-b - a pre-programmed \right_image:sidious directive commanding the Clones to turn on their Jedi leaders!  \n \right_image:clonetrooper Suddenly under fire and running for his life, \b Obi-Wan \-b must evade his former allies and find a way back to \b Coruscant\-b...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_14]\left_image:anakinhood \right_image:sidious On \b Coruscant\-b, the \b Jedi Order \-b is broken and the Temple is in ruins.  With no one left to oppose him, \b Darth Sidious \-b is ready to declare the \b Clone Wars \-b over and appoint himself Emperor of the galaxy.  The only matter left to attend to is the remaining Separatist leaders, who are in hiding in the \b Mustafar \-b system. \right_image:mustafar \b Sidious \-b dispatches \b Darth Vader \-b to the volcanic world to end their lives with a final betrayal...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_15]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:clonetrooper After surviving \b Order 66 \-b, \b Obi-Wan Kenobi \-b endeavors to prevent the \b Jedi Order's \-b devastation.  \right_image:yoda Reunited with \b Yoda \-b aboard \b Senator Bail Organa's \-b personal starship, the Jedi plan a return to \right_image:coruscant \b Coruscant\-b, hoping to find clues to their mysterious and dire situation within the Jedi Temple...
[IDS_OVERVIEW_16]\left_image:obi-wan \right_image:mustafar Learning of \b Anakin's \-b descent into darkness while inside the \b Jedi Temple\-b, \right_image:anakinhood \b Obi-Wan \-b travels to \b Mustafar \-b for a final confrontation with his old friend and former Padawan.
[IDS_OVERVIEW_17]\left_image:anakinhood \right_image:mustafar With the Separatist leaders on \b Mustafar \-b now eliminated, \b Darth Vader \-b prepares to return to \b Coruscant \-b \right_image:obi-wan only to find his former friend and master, \b Obi-Wan Kenobi\-b, waiting for him.  Accusations fly between the two, and it becomes clear to the young Sith Lord that \b Palpatine \-b was right: \b Obi-Wan\-b, too, has been tainted by the Jedi’s corruption and must also be destroyed...
