	<!-- =================== ANIMATION RELATED =================== -->

	<!-- When in hard coded attack mode, if an NPC is moving using advancing or advancing-aim states,
	     and if the destination point is less than this distance away then the NPC will walk, otherwise it
	     will run -->
	<RunDistance>120.0</RunDistance>	 <!-- 500.0 Reduced so don't walk as much -->

	<!-- If the target is within this distance of the attacker, the attacker will not use crouching aim -->
	<!-- NB. The chance of an npc crouching at range can be modified using status values on each npc -->

	<!-- Shooting from the hip -->
	<ShootFromHipRange>1000.0</ShootFromHipRange>	<!-- Defines the boundary between near and far -->

	<!-- =================== MODE CHOOSING =================== -->
	
	<!-- These determine which mode the character chooses ie. attack or defense
	     (see TacticalEquations design document)-->

	<!-- Backup constants -->

	<BackupModifier>0.15</BackupModifier>
	<FireRateModifier>0.5</FireRateModifier>


	<!-- ================== QUICK DEFENSE ================ -->

	<!-- Quick defense is used when a NPC wants to use defensive tactics but there is no cover nearby.
		 Quick defense tries to move the NPC out of as many attacker's view cones as possible.
		 The NPC will continue to shoot at its target (where possible) while it is moving.
		 Upon reaching its quick defense destination, the NPC will not be able to use quick defense
		 again until the specified delay has elapsed. -->

	<!-- The radius (in cm) around the NPC within which cover points are considered to be nearby.
		 If there are no cover points (attack obstruction nodes) within this range, quick defense
		 will be used instead of full defensive mode. -->
	<CoverRange>2000.0</CoverRange>

	<!-- The radius (in cm) around the NPC to consider points from when choosing a quick defense point -->
	<QuickDefenseRange>1500.0</QuickDefenseRange>

	<!-- The time (in seconds) delay from a NPC arriving at a quick defense point before the NPC can use quick defense again -->
	<QuickDefenseDelay>1.5</QuickDefenseDelay>	<!-- 1.5 -->


	<!-- =================== SEARCHING =================== -->
	
	<!-- Global constants that affect NPC search behaviour -->
	
	<!-- The distance around an investigation point to patrol while investigating a sound -->
	<InvestigateRange>800.0</InvestigateRange>

	<!-- This boosts the npc's vision range during attack -->
	<InViewLastTimeBias>1.8</InViewLastTimeBias>
	
	<!-- These next modifiers should add up to 1.0 to define -->
	<!-- their combined impact on reducing vision range -->
	<!-- Pose is now a direct modifier, Alertness is no longer used -->
	<IlluminationModifier>0.5</IlluminationModifier>
	<AlertnessModifier>0.0</AlertnessModifier>
	<MovementSpeedModifier>0.5</MovementSpeedModifier>
	<PoseModifier>0.0</PoseModifier>
	
	<!-- One of these two multipliers will be used depending on which part of the -->
	<!-- player is visible in order to reduce the overall vision range -->
	<SneakModeModifierHead>0.5</SneakModeModifierHead>
	<SneakModeModifierBody>0.8</SneakModeModifierBody>

	
	<!-- =================== COMBAT MOVEMENT SETTINGS =================== -->
	<!-- TurnAndRunRange - when a NPC is in combat and chooses a point to move to and that point is
						   further away than TurnAndRunRange then the NPC stops pointing at its target
						   and moves to the chosen point.  If the point is closer than TurnAndRunRange,
						   the NPC moves to the point but continues to face its target.	-->
	<TurnAndRunRange>500.0</TurnAndRunRange>	<!-- 2000.0 -->
	
	<!-- ReloadRange - the radius around an NPC to search for waypoints in the reload behaviour -->
	<ReloadRange>1000.0</ReloadRange>			<!-- 1500.0 -->

	<!-- ==================== LIGHT / HEAVY WOUNDING ==================== -->
	<!-- HeavyDamage - determines the health loss required to cause a heavy wounded anim to be played.
					   If health_loss < HeavyDamage then play light wounded, else play heavy wounded. -->
	<HeavyDamage>30.0</HeavyDamage>
